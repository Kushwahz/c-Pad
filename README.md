**c-Pad (College pad)** is an android mobile application for college students and teachers which unifies and bring every college needs in their hand via mobile phones. The most important and crucial resource for any student and teacher is their time. This application mainly focuses on how to solve the problem of time killing routine activities for a student and teacher. If we look at the daily schedule of any college student, then there are lots of repetitive tasks which include:

- Keeping daily records of the lectures to be attended
- Keep check on the noticeboard about important notices and events
- Looking for teachers after the lecture to clear course related doubts
- To find and meet other officials to get done the official work related to college
- To find any friend, classmate, senior or junior, to get their whereabouts and contacting them
- To gather class notes, assignments
- To get update and other related queries regarding attendance

And many more others similar routine task for which students have to visit far college corners and gather all this information. On the other hand for a teacher, similar repetitive tasks are to be accomplished daily like:

- Floating important news and notices about various college events to each and every student with assurance, 
- Keeping record of lectures to be taken and making adjustments, 
- Keeping track of every student data, contacting defaulters and their guardians for the concerned reasons, 
- To find the whereabouts of any teacher or student and contacting them,

Also many other related tasks for which teachers too have to wander offices and classrooms. Thus achieving all these daily tasks for students and teachers, it becomes very tiring and is also wastage of time. So to provide a single solution to all these problems, this android application has been designed. It has two modules, one for the college students and the other for the college teachers.
